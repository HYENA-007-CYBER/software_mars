## **7. Overall Learning Experience**

Working through the MaRS Recruitment Task was both intellectually stimulating and highly rewarding. Here's what I gained from this experience:

- **System-Level Thinking:** Through the Bash scripting and Linux-based tasks, I developed a deeper understanding of how real rover systems might operate, with emphasis on diagnostics, file handling, and command-line automation.

- **Algorithmic Problem Solving:** The Medium Dose challenges helped sharpen my skills in string processing, cipher breaking, spatial logic, and filtering algorithms â€” all essential in autonomous robotics and embedded systems.

- **Mathematical Modeling & Orientation:** Implementing 3D to 4D orientation conversions introduced me to quaternions and their role in spatial navigation, which is crucial for robotics and aerospace applications.

- **Data Noise Handling:** Comparing different filters (Muchiko, Sanchiko, Hybrid) gave me practical insight into how sensor data can be cleaned for real-time decision-making.

- **Pathfinding & Grid Analysis:** In the Hard Dose, I learned how to build and navigate grid-based maps using BFS. This solidified my understanding of graph traversal in constrained environments.

- **Behavior Tree Design:** Creating a decision-making structure for the rover taught me how complex logic can be broken down into maintainable, visual components â€” a powerful concept in robotics programming.

- **Version Control & Documentation:** Throughout the task, I followed Git best practices and wrote clear, structured documentation to reflect industry-level coding standards.

> ðŸš€ Overall, this challenge felt like a real-world mission planning exercise. It tested my logic, coding clarity, and ability to think like a robotic systems engineer â€” and I thoroughly enjoyed the journey.

## **6. Task Breakdown**

###  **Light Dose**

#### ðŸ”¹ Question 1: Rover System Check
- Simulated a series of rover diagnostics using a Bash script.
- Used conditional statements and process outputs to mimic real-time behavior.

**Challenges Faced:**
- Debugging syntax errors and ensuring correct logical flow in the shell script.
- Handling command outputs for different system checks.

**My Approach:**
- Broke the problem into individual checks and tested each block.
- Used `echo` and `if-else` constructs to validate system behavior step by step.
**Script:** [light_2nd.sh](./light_2nd.sh)

#### ðŸ”¹ Question 2: Terminal-Based Rover Task
- Practiced common Linux commands related to navigation, file handling, and permissions.
- Reinforced shell scripting skills through real-world robotic context.

**Challenges Faced:**
- Remembering specific syntax for file and directory operations.
- Understanding permission errors and how to resolve them.

**My Approach:**
- Referred to Linux man pages and practiced each command in the terminal.
- Used `chmod`, `ls -l`, and `pwd` to verify operations and access rights.

### ðŸŸ¡ **Medium Dose**

#### ðŸ”¹ Question 1: Marker Navigation
- Wrote a function to decode directions from grid markers.
- Used matrix manipulation to simulate rover movement.

**Challenges Faced:**
- Navigating a 2D grid based on encoded markers.
